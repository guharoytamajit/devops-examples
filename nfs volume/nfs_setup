Let's say we want to export our users' home directories in /home/users. First we create the export filesystem:

>sudo mkdir -p /mnt/sharedfolder

As we want all clients to access the directory, we will remove restrictive permissions of the export folder through the following commands:
>sudo chown nobody:nogroup /mnt/sharedfolder
>sudo chmod 777 /mnt/sharedfolder                   #Now all users from all groups on the client system will be able to access our “sharedfolder”

>sudo nano /etc/exports

Once you have opened the file, you can allow access to:

A single client by adding the following line in the file:
/mnt/sharedfolder clientIP(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
Multiple clients by adding the following lines in the file:
/mnt/sharedfolder client1IP(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
/mnt/sharedfolder client2IP(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
Multiple clients, by specifying an entire subnet that the clients belong to:
/mnt/sharedfolder subnetIP/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)

Where:
rw => read and write operations
sync => write any change to the disc before applying it
no_subtree_check=> prevent subtree checking


add following line to /etc/exports:
/mnt/sharedfolder *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,insecure)



Export the shared directory:
>sudo exportfs -rav
>sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server

check what you are exporting and to whom?
>showmount -e
=====================
Mounting exported NFS on client:
>sudo mkdir -p /mnt/sharedfolder_client

Check what is avaiable for mounting:
>showmount -e 192.168.0.105   #192.168.0.105 is the ip of nfs server

Mount:
>sudo mount 192.168.0.105:/mnt/sharedfolder /mnt/sharedfolder_client

Unmount:
>sudo umount /mnt/sharedfolder_client
